# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description


My motivation behind this project was to create a portfolio website with a style that fits my personality. I chose to build this project because I wanted to get more practice with working with CSS. The problem that my project solves is that it makes my portfolio easy to navigate and simple to use. While working on this project I learned more about how to format in CSS and organizing my code.
